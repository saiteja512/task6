#Task-6

ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis
Analyze monthly revenue and order volume with a simple SQL script.
No fussâ€”just group by month and year, sum up the cash, and count those orders.

How it works:

Extract month & year from order_date
Sum up amount for total revenue
Count unique order_id for order volume
Sort and filter as needed
Run the script, check the trends, and spot whatâ€™s hot (or not) in your sales! ðŸ˜Ž
